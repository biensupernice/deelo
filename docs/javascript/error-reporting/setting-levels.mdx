Setting error levels when capturing errors can be a helpful tool. When you set a
level you gain the ability to categorize errors at a high-level based on
urgency.

## Levels

- Fatal: Any error that is forcing a shutdown or outage of a service or
  application. Reserve these only for the most heinous errors and situations.

- Error: Any error which is fatal to an operation, but not to a service or
  application (can't open a required file, missing data, etc.). These errors will
  force user (administrator, or direct user) intervention. These are usually
  reserved for incorrect urls, corrupt data, etc.

- Warn: Anything that can potentially cause application oddities, but for which
  I am automatically recovering.

- Debug: Information that is diagnostically helpful to people more than just
  developers (IT, sysadmins, etc.).
