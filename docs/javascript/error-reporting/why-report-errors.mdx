## Reporting errors is important

Reporting errors to Dextr helps you make sense of types of errors that could be
impacting your users. Whether it's failed runtime errors related to an api
service that is having a black out or a typo in your code, reporting those errors
can help you gain insight into what may be going wrong for your users and maybe
even help you solve them faster.

### Failed API Call

When your users are in your application there are many unexpected scenarios that 
could play out. For example, what happens if one of your core services is 
experiencing an outage, and your users aren't able to use a core part of your 
application? You are going to start hearing from them loudly and you might go 
through scouring your logs, but if the outage is severe and logs aren't helpful 
then it can become difficult to pin down what's going wrong. However, Dextr can 
help here by displaying the errors that your users captured and narrowing down 
the point of failure:

```javascript
import Dextr from "@dextr/browser";

async function getDataFromAPI () {
  try {
    const res = await fetch("...");
    const data = await res.json();
    return data;
  } catch (e) {
    // Capture the failed network request
    Dextr.captureError(e);
    showFailedAPICallNotification(e);
  }
}
```

### A careless typo

Typos happen to the best of us, and most times our editors or tooling will help 
catch them in development, but sometimes, our tooling can fail us, and when that 
happens, we don't want to be kept in the dark, because debugging production is 
__hard__. Here is an example:

```javascript
import Dextr from "@dextr/browser";

async function getDataFromAPI () {
  try {
    const res = await fetch("...");
    const data = await res.jsn(); //<--- Typo here should be: res.json();
    return data;
  } catch (e) {
    Dextr.captureError(e);
    showFailedAPICallNotification(e);
  }
}
```
