Welcome to the Dextr documentation for javascript! Dextr provides serveral tools
that will make events monitoring, error reporting, scheduling work, etc. easy to
use!

There are 2 primary reasons for using our SDK.

1. Instrument your code, to report errors, monitor events, etc.
2. Access data from our platform of errors, events, scheduled work, etc. in
   order to build your own in house UI for your application or organization.

## Install

Let's get the ball rolling, open up your terminal and use your preferred package
manager to install `@dextr/browser`:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @dextr/browser

# Using yarn
yarn add @dextr/browser
```

## Configuring Dextr

Setting up Dextr is a painless task, Dextr takes a requires a few fields before
being ready to roll:

```javascript
import Dextr from "@dextr/browser";

Dextr.init({
  url: 'https://${YOUR_UNIQUE_Dextr_SCOPE}.dextr.io',
  release: '2.12.4',
  environment: 'production',
});
```

## Usage

Here is a nice simple example of capturing an error in your frontend application, 
a asyncronous function that may encounter an error:

```javascript
import Dextr from "@dextr/browser";

async function doSomething () {
  try {
    ...
  } catch (e) {
    Dextr.captureError(e);
    ...
  }
}
```
